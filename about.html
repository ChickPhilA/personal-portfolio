                        My name is <span class="text-orange-400">Phillipe</span> (pronounced "fil-LEP") or you can call me <span class="text-orange-400">Phil</span>.
                        I am a Southern California native, born and raised around Los Angeles as well as Orange County, and currently residing in the Inland Empire.
                        I am of Filipino heritage and take great pride of my culture and identity.
                        <br><br>
                        I believe my family has helped me foster an early interest in technology. My interest in Computer Science and software engineering first started when I was only 4-years old.
                        My father works in IT, so I was able to get my hands on a computer which helped me obtain an early understanding of PCs at a young age,
                        and my older sister owned a Nintendo Gamecube.
                        <br><br>
                        One of my sister's games was <i>Super Monkey Ball</i>  and I was fascinated by the game's mechanics. Just the idea alone that pushing your joystick up,
                        communicates an input that causes the monkey on my TV screen to roll forward in a ball was astonishing to me as a kid.From there, I was intriuged on technology
                        and video games, and I wanted to learn the "behind-the-scenes" of how these things worked. As of today, I forever acknowledge that experience as my defining moment
                        that led me to pursue a career in Software Engineering.

                            When I was an undergraduate at UC Irvine, I enrolled in academically rigorous and theory-heavy Computer Science courses that
                            challenged my problem-solving skills, mental fortitude, adapatability, and collaboration effort(s). Despite the difficulty of nature
                            in such academia, it is no doubt that these experiences have shaped my intrigue in Software Engineering and provided me a glimpse of the industry.
                            <br><br>
                            I was also a member of <span class="text-blue-400 transition duration-300 ease-in-out hover:text-yellow-400">

                            and represent Filipinx students pursuing STEM in the UCI community. Through this organization, I was involved in the FUSION ICS (Information & Computer Sciences)
                            Project, where I collaborated with fellow members to develop a web application that represents the five pillars of FUSION: <i>Social Support,
                            Professionalism, Academia, Culture, and Engineering</i>. Feel free to click on the <i>Projects</i> tab to learn more about thisproject and others that I've worked on!

                            During my free time, I would usually cook in my apartment, play video games, do spontaneous Costco trips, or hang out with friends at local spots around Irvine
                            as well as exploring Orange County. Some favorite spots of mine include <i>Hironori Craft Ramen</i>, <i>Da Vien Coffee</i>,
                            and <i>Seaside Donuts</i> at 3 AM with my friends! Click on the <i>Misc.</i> tab to learn more fun facts about me!
