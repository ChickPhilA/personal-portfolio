                        My name is Phillipe (pronounced "fil-LEP") or you can call me Phil. I am a Southern California native, born and raised around Los Angeles as well as Orange County, and currently residing in the Inland Empire.
                        I am of Filipino heritage and am prideful to be part of such a vibrant and diverse community.
                        <br><br>
                        I believe my family helped me foster an early interest in technology. My interest in Computer Science and software engineering first started when I was only 4-years old. My father works in IT, so I was able to get my hands on a computer at an early age,
                        and my older sister owned a Nintendo Gamecube.
                        <br><br>
                        One of my sister's games was <i>Super Monkey Ball</i> and I was fascinated by the game's mechanics. Just the idea alone that pushing your joystick up, communicates an input that
                        causes the monkey to roll forward in a ball on my TV screen was mind-blowing to me as a kid. Just like that, I was hooked on technology and computers.
