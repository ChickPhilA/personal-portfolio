                        My name is <span class="text-orange-400">Phillipe</span> (pronounced "fil-LEP") — you can call me
                        <span class="text-orange-400">Phil</span>. I’m a Southern California native, raised around Los Angeles and Orange
                        County, and I currently live in the Inland Empire. As a Filipino-American, I carry that pride with
                        me in how I show up: grounded, curious, and community-minded. 🇵🇭
                        <br><br>
                        My interest in technology started early. With my dad working in IT, I was introduced to computers at a young age —
                        and thanks to my older sister’s Nintendo GameCube, I became obsessed with the idea that a simple input could create
                        something interactive on-screen. That curiosity has never left me ever since.
                        <br><br>
                        Today, I’m still driven by that same “behind-the-scenes” fascination — learning how things work, 
                        building thoughtful software, and constantly improving my craft. 💡🎮

                            During my time at UC Irvine, I took rigorous, theory-heavy Computer Science courses that strengthened my

                            reinforced my interest in <span class="font-semibold">software engineering</span> and building real-world systems. ⚙️
