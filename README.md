# personal-portfolio
This is a personal portfolio that showcases details about me, my educational journey, projects and skills, as well as extra (fun) facts about me. Initially built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but new technologies, frameworks, etc. will be integrated over time. Thanks for reading!

UPDATE (11/26/2025): Finished developing the projects page, provided with interactive and 3D-animated
cards displaying project title on front and description that flips upon hover.
