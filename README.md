# personal-portfolio
This is a personal portfolio that showcases details about me, my educational journey, projects and skills, as well as extra (fun) facts about me. Initially built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but new technologies, frameworks, etc. will be integrated over time. Thanks for reading!

UPDATE (11/12/2025): Progress on the Project page. Created a project card for Fabflix. Testing out animations to expand width and height when card is hovered over.
