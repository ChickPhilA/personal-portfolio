# personal-portfolio
This is a personal portfolio that showcases details about me, my educational journey, projects and skills, as well as extra (fun) facts about me. Initially built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but new technologies, frameworks, etc. will be integrated over time. Thanks for reading!

UPDATE (2/13/2025): Final polishes on portfolio. Removed Misc. section for the meantime for professional reasons, as well as maintaining a clean yet simple navigation structore of the portfolio. Changed personal background photo on the About me page. Moved About tab to end of navigation bar, to prioritize professional webpages more.
