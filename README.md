# personal-portfolio
This is a personal portfolio that showcases details about me, my educational journey, projects and skills, as well as extra (fun) facts about me. Initially built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but new technologies, frameworks, etc. will be integrated over time. Thanks for reading!

UPDATE (11/12/2025): Completed the foundation for my About me Page! I will add a slideshow to the pictures in the Personal Background and Education section in the future, while my focus is shifting to the design and development of the Projects page.
